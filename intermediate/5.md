# Unit 5
## Present Perfect Simple vs Present Perfect Continuous

Use the Present **Perfect Continuous** to talk about:

1.Unfinished actions which started in the past and continue in the present. The Present Perfect Continuous ephasises the continuation of the activity.

2.Recently finished activity with present results. Often we can see these results.

Why are you hot?
I have been running.
NOT: I have run.

3.Situations where we focus on the activity not the result.

I **have been studying**. (this is why I haven't seen you) BUT **I have finished** my work. (this is the result)

4.Same as above, particularly using How long to focus on the activity.  We often use How much/many to focus on the result.

**How long have** you **been saving** money (want tot know about the result)

**How much** money **have** you **saved**? (want to know about the result)

We don't use the Present Perfect Continuous with 'state' verbs: know, be, like, etc.

## Verb patterns with infinitive or gerund

1.Verbs followed by -ing:
verbs of feeling, e.g. can't stand, like, love, enjoy, don't mind

2.Verbs followrd by the infinitive:
agree, promise, want, choose, decide

3.Many verbs can use the pattern: verb + somebody + to + infinitive:
allow, help, want, remind, would like, advise, iinvite, tell

4.Some verbs can be followed by both forms: begin, start, continue, stop, remember

Sometimes the meaning changes.

Verb        | Gerund | Infinitive
--- |---| ---
| stop | I **stopped smoking**. = I gave up the habit.| I **stopped to smoke**. = I had a break from what I was doing in order to have a cigarette. |
| remember | **I remembered to call her**. = I called her (i didn't forget) because it was my responsibility.| I **remember calling** her. =  I have a memory of this past action. |

## Countable/uncountable nouns

### Countable
A countable noun can be singular or plurarl. We can count countable nouns (1 apple, 2 apples, etc.)
She eats an apple a day. I love eating apples.

With singular countable nouns we can use a or an.

### Uncountable
Uncountable nouns have only one form, no singular or plural. We cannot count uncountable nouns.

**some** rice/**a kilo of** rice NOT: one rice, two rices

In Asia people eat rice with every meal.

We cannot say a rice, so we specify a .. of ..

**A cup of** coffee, **a bottle of** water...

Uncountable nouns are generally not used in the plural, e.g. information, news, hair, advice, paper.

Can I have some inforamtion? NOT: -Informations-

Some uncountable nouns are used only in plural form, e.g. scissors, jeans.

I bought some jeans/a pair of jeans. NOT: -a jeans-
