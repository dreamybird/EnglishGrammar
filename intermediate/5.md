# Unit 5
## Present Perfect Simple vs Present Perfect Continuous

Use the Present **Perfect Continuous** to talk about:

1.Unfinished actions which started in the past and continue in the present. The Present Perfect Continuous ephasises the continuation of the activity.

2.Recently finished activity with present results. Often we can see these results.

Why are you hot?
I have been running.
NOT: I have run.

3.Situations where we focus on the activity not the result.

I **have been studying**. (this is why I haven't seen you) BUT **I have finished** my work. (this is the result)

4.Same as above, particularly using How long to focus on the activity.  We often use How much/many to focus on the result.

**How long have** you **been saving** money (want tot know about the result)

**How much** money **have** you **saved**? (want to know about the result)

We don't use the Present Perfect Continuous with 'state' verbs: know, be, like, etc.

## Verb patterns with infinitive or gerund

1.Verbs followed by -ing:
verbs of feeling, e.g. can't stand, like, love, enjoy, don't mind

2.Verbs followrd by the infinitive:
agree, promise, want, choose, decide

3.Many verbs can use the pattern: verb + somebody + to + infinitive:
allow, help, want, remind, would like, advise, iinvite, tell

4.Some verbs can be followed by both forms: begin, start, continue, stop, remember

Sometimes the meaning changes.
